This sample app was built using  .NET Core2.0 MVC.
My technical background is ASP.NET and C# so it was a natural choice for me to go with .NET Core 2.0.

Why .NET Core2.0?  beucase one of the requirment is to host is sample app in heroku, I chose .NET Core as it can be deployed on different 
platforms. Linux & macOS are 2 examoples. While MVC Apps only deplyed on Windows platform.

I have been disconnected for coding for many years , so it took me a couple of days to refresh my memory then I started the .NET Core 2.0
MVC web app.  I've done research on the issues I faced on the net. For example, how to consume a JSON REST API in .NET.

One of the neat things I found is a Web app wich converts a JSON string to a C# class. It is called : http://json2csharp.com/
This saved my time of writing the model class.

Other things I learned is installing the GitHub extension for Visual studio. It didn't work ok at first, but when I
installed the latest update of Visual Studio (ver 15.6.1), all worked fine.

The sample does not exactly look appealing as my focus was to learn how to implement and integrate the app VS putting time
on the design.  If I had more time, I would propably installed a 3rd party UI controls , like Telerik,
